/**
 * NerdResolve badge.
 *
 * Shared signature mark across every NerdResolve-built site: the glasses logo
 * pinned to the bottom-right of the footer, faint at rest and fully opaque on
 * hover or keyboard focus.
 *
 * No event handlers on purpose - the hover/focus transition is pure CSS so
 * this stays a Server Component. Adding onMouseEnter would force every footer
 * that renders it to become a Client Component (and breaks the Next.js App
 * Router build outright).
 *
 * Positioning: renders a zero-height anchor and pins the badge to the
 * footer's own bottom-right corner using `position: fixed`-like offsets
 * relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. To stay consistent across
 * sites whose footers have different inner padding, the anchor escapes any
 * inner container by being placed as the last child of <footer> and using
 * negative insets that cancel typical footer padding.
 *
 * Drop it as the last child inside <footer>.
